# currency-converter

I made this project to learn more about APIs and learn react.

At the start i had no idea on how to use react hooks and i taught myself on how to use them while making this project.

First page is a currency converter, i got the data using Currency Data API from apilayer.com
Second page is a table of conversion rates on every single currency available from the API using USD as base comparison

I used React, currency API from APIlayer and used bootstrap 5, react-bootstrap-table to set the layouts.
